1. Read MBR at sector 0

Contains Partition Info
Check Partition 0
Contains number of first sector (2048)

2. Go to sector 2048 (as read above)

This is the FAT32 Boot Sector

bytes per sector = 512 (always)
number of FATs = 2
sectors per cluster = 16
reserved sectors = 32
hidden sectors = 2048 (sectors preceding the start of the partition, if the drive is partitioned)
sectors per FAT = 15178
root cluster = 2 (always)


to find the start of the File Allocation Table
 = hidden sectors + reserved sectors
 = 2048 + 32
 = 2080

to get the start of the root directory
root directory start sector = hidden sectors + reserved sectors + (number of FATs * sectors per FAT)

2048 + 32 + (2 * 15178)
2048 + 32 + 30356
2048 + 30388

= sector 32436 (cluster 2)

3. Go to root directory, scan for desired file

Look in directory entry for desired file

Find number of cluster

217062

start sector of the file = ((file cluster - 2) * sectors per cluster) + boot sector

((217062 - 2) * 16) + 32436
(217060 * 16) + 32436
3472960 + 32436

= sector 3505396
